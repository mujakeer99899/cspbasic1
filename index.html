        <!-- Week 1 -->
       <div class="section">
            <h2>Week 1: Initial Survey and Problem Identification</h2>
            <p><strong>Activities:</strong> Conducted preliminary visits to water bodies in the community, collected initial water samples, and interacted with residents to understand their concerns.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong> Water sources showed visible signs of pollution, including turbidity, foul odors, and algal blooms. Residents reported frequent health issues such as diarrhea and skin infections.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Established a foundation for detailed investigations in the subsequent weeks.</p>
            
        </div>

        <!-- Week 2 -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Week 2: Detailed Sampling and Testing</h2>
            <p><strong>Activities:</strong> Focused on collecting and analyzing samples from surface water (ponds, canals) and groundwater (borewells, wells) for physical, chemical, and biological contaminants.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong> Detected high levels of nitrates, phosphates, and coliform bacteria in water sources. Industrial effluents were identified as a major contributor to heavy metal contamination.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Confirmed the presence of multiple pollutants and identified probable sources.</p>
            
        </div>

        <!-- Week 3 -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Week 3: Agricultural Impact Assessment</h2>
            <p><strong>Activities:</strong> Surveyed agricultural areas to understand the role of fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation practices in contributing to water pollution.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong> Runoff from farmlands was found to carry excess nutrients and chemicals into nearby canals and ponds, causing eutrophication and algal blooms.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Highlighted the need for sustainable farming practices to reduce chemical runoff.</p>
            
        </div>

        <!-- Week 4 -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Week 4: Urban Waste Management Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Activities:</strong> Inspected urban waste disposal practices, including solid waste dumping and sewage discharge. Studied the proximity of waste disposal sites to water bodies.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong> Indiscriminate dumping of solid waste and untreated sewage into canals were major contributors to water quality degradation. Microplastics were prevalent in water samples.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Identified a lack of structured waste management systems as a significant problem.</p>
            
        </div>

        <!-- Week 5 -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Week 5: Health Impact Survey</h2>
            <p><strong>Activities:</strong> Worked with local healthcare providers to assess the prevalence of waterborne diseases. Collected anecdotal and statistical health data from residents.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong> High rates of diseases such as dysentery, cholera, and skin allergies were linked to the consumption of polluted water. Long-term exposure was associated with chronic health risks.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Established a direct link between water pollution and public health issues.</p>
           
        </div>

        <!-- Week 6 -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Week 6: Community Engagement and Feedback</h2>
            <p><strong>Activities:</strong> Conducted community workshops to raise awareness about water pollution and gather feedback on proposed solutions.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong> Residents expressed concerns about inadequate access to clean drinking water and lack of infrastructure for waste and sewage treatment.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Garnered community support for collaborative initiatives aimed at reducing pollution.</p>
            
        </div>

        <!-- Week 7 -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Week 7: Stakeholder Collaboration and Policy Review</h2>
            <p><strong>Activities:</strong> Engaged with local authorities, NGOs, and community leaders to discuss policy gaps, enforcement challenges, and infrastructure needs.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong> Identified weak enforcement of environmental regulations and a lack of funding for essential infrastructure like sewage treatment plants.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Proposed policy improvements and began planning community-led monitoring initiatives.</p>
            
        </div>

        <!-- Week 8 -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Week 8: Cumulative Impact Assessment and Action Planning</h2>
            <p><strong>Activities:</strong> Assessed long-term environmental and economic impacts of water pollution on the community. Collaborated with residents to create an action plan for sustainable water management.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong> Pollution trends have worsened over the past decade, affecting public health, biodiversity, and livelihoods. However, community willingness to engage in solutions offers hope.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Developed a roadmap for addressing water pollution through infrastructure upgrades, sustainable practices, and enhanced community involvement.</p>
